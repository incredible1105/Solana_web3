/**
 * A union of every Solana error code
 *
 * You might be wondering why this is not a TypeScript enum or const enum.
 *
 * One of the goals of this library is to enable people to use some or none of it without having to
 * bundle all of it.
 *
 * If we made the set of error codes an enum then anyone who imported it (even if to only use a
 * single error code) would be forced to bundle every code and its label.
 *
 * Const enums appear to solve this problem by letting the compiler inline only the codes that are
 * actually used. Unfortunately exporting ambient (const) enums from a library like `@solana/errors`
 * is not safe, for a variety of reasons covered here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28818850
